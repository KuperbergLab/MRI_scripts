#MRI Processing at the Kuperberg Lab

Note: These things will only work at The Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging

##About
This folder contains all our scripts for processing MRI data at the Martinos Center. The
most important file is semprmm_pipeline, a python script that steers all processing.

Other interesting files include:

-	MakeMultCond.m that, along with Log2MultCond\_v4.m, transforms .vtsd\_log files to multiple
condition files for use with SPM.
-	spm\_batches/ includes all the spm batch files (for all types of subjects)
-	surf\_analysis/ contains the things for 
-	pipeline.py provides basic functionality to semprmm\_pipeline and can be used in other
Kuperberg MRI pipelines.

## semprmm\_pipeline
This script facilitates the following processing steps:

-	MRI Processing (using SPM and FreeSurfer)
	-	Copying DICOM images from the archives to our cluster
	-	Unpacking/transforming the DICOM images to usable NiFTi files.
	-	Setting up and running preprocessing
	-	Setting up and running first-level statistics 
	-	Setting up and running second-level statistics
	-	Using FreeSurfer to project activity onto the surface and packaging these results into an
easy to browse archive.
-	MEG Processing (using MNE)
	-	Running preprocessing and anatomical processing
	- 	Computing the forward/inverse solution
	
### Usage
The general way to use this script is:
`semprmm_pipeline [options] subject (more subjects)`
You can specify multiple subjects in one call, but at least one. Whatever option(s) you pass will be
applied to all.

### Options
Note the following conventions:

-	DICOM\_DIR is /cluster/kuperberg/SemPrMM/MRI/dicoms/
-	FUNCTIONALS\_DIR is /cluster/kuperberg/SemPrMM/MRI/functionals

####-d,--copy\_dicom
This option copies all the dicom images that were produced by the scanner into your study directory.
It parses the output of 'findsession [subject]' and sets up an rsync job like so: `rysnc -a
[path/from/findsession/] DICOM_DIR/[subject]/`
This is hardcoded to use the newest path.

####--scan\_only
This option runs `unpacksdcmdir -src DICOM_DIR/subject/ -targ FUNCTIONALS_DIR/[subject]/ -scanonly
FUNCTIONALS_DIR/[subject]/scan.log`
The most important output of this is the scan.log file.

####--scan2cfg
This transforms the scan.log file into cfg.txt that is useful for --unpack.

##### Notes
Currently, these MRI runs are unpacked into the FUNCTIONALS\_DIR/[subject] folder:
-	MEMPRAGE\_4e\_p2\_1mm\_iso scans unpack into MPRAGE/
	-	Only the rms image (which has 1 frame and is the best image) is unpacked, not the 4 frame
MEMPRAGE
-	ge\_functionals\_atlloc scans unpack into ATLLoc/
-	field\_mapping scans unpack into FieldMap/
	-	These scans are named FieldMap\_[study after which they were run]\_Phase.nii and
FieldMap\_[study after which they were run]\_Mag.nii
	-	If you didn't collect a FieldMap after a particular study:
		-	After you run this step, copy the closest matching FieldMaps into two XXX directories
(the XXX's don't matter but is some three digit string) and rename them according to the above
format. The rest of the pipeline will fail if this isn't done.
-	ge\_functionals\_maskmm scans unpack into MaskedMM/
-	ge\_functionals\_baleen scans unpack into BaleenMM/
-	MEFLASH\_8e\_1mm\_iso\_5deg scans unpack into MEFLASH/
-	Only the rms scan (which has 1 frame) is unpacked, as opposed to the first MEFLASH scan which
has 8 frames
-	ge\_functionals\_axcpt and ge\_functionals\_axcpt_\sc scans unpack into AXCPT/
-	Any scan in which an error occured (the third column in scan.log) will not be unpacked
-	If this doesn't make sense, see the scan.log file
-	The .nii files are sequentially numbered, e.g. the 5th run of Baleen is named BaleenMM5.nii

####--unpack
This option runs `unpacksdcmdir -src DICOM_DIR/subject/ -targ FUNCTIONALS_DIR/[subject]/ -fsfast -cfg FUNCTIONALS_DIR/[subject]/cfg.txt`
This actually does the major DICOM -> Nifti conversion (and renaming).

#####Notes

-	Because the -fsfast option is used, the .nii files wind up in a directory called 'XXX' where
XXX is a zero-padded number that corresponds to the run number.
-	This (and --scan_only) take a very long time, so try to do this only once.

####-u,--unpack\_all
This options wraps up --scan\_only,--scan2cfg, and --unpack into one easy call. Use this when you're
confident scan.log will turn out nice (i.e. the scanning session went normal).

####-p,--setup\_preproc
With the images unpacked and converted, it's time to start processing them. The first processing
that occurs is called preprocessing and we use SPM to do this. I've set up a generic batch script
for ATLLoc, MaskedMM, BaleenMM, and AXCPT. These files are found in spm\_batches. 
The four files of interest are atlloc\_preproc\_job.m, axcpt\_preproc\_job.m, baleenmm\_preproc\_job.m, and maskedmm\_preproc\_job.m.

Each of these four files defines a full preprocessing pipeline that includes unwarping and realignment,
slice timing correction, coregistration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing (open any of
these files SPM's batch editor to see specific details of these jobs).

By design though, all the pathnames in these files are wrong. For example, the phase fieldmap
defined in atlloc\_preproc\_job.m is literally
'/cluster/kuperberg/SemPrMM/MRI/functionals/[subject]/FieldMap/[FieldMapPhaseXXX]/
FieldMap\_ATLLoc\_Phase.nii' which clearly doesn't exist after the unpack command. So, a large part of
this section of the pipeline is taking these 4 generic batches and filling in the correct paths to the unpacked images. This file is written to
FUNCTIONALS\_DIR/[subject]/[study]/jobs/[study]\_preproc\_job.m

The batches themselves are useless without a script to run them, though. A matlab script called
FUNCTIONALS\_DIR/[subject]/[study]/jobs/[study]\_preproc.m is created that looks like this :


####-o,--setup\_outliers
This option does the same --setup\_preproc except first-level statistics scripts are setup.
