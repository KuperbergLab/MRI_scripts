		<h1>Semantic Priming Multi-Modal Study</h1>
		<p>SemPrMM is a multimodal imaging (MEG-EEG and fMRI) project with healthy adults and schizophrenia patients begun in Fall 2010. This project includes the 'Baleen' and 'MaskMM' paradigms. Ellen is the PI of an NIH NRSA supporting her salary to pursue the Baleen project.  Scan time and additional support is provided by other sources including Gina's R01, for which 'MaskedMM' and the inhibition/conflict measures we are collecting are relevant. </p>
		<p>The theoretical focus of Baleen is to understand the neural mechanisms involved in top-down prediction and lexical selection in language comprehension, and how these mechanisms are impacted in schizophrenia patients, who are known to have difficulties in using the broader context for processing. A critical <i>methodological</i> focus is to study the relationship between MEG-EEG evoked responses and fMRI responses, a relationship which is still very poorly understood.</p>
		<p>Ellen's grant proposes two main studies. One is the semantic priming study which will be conducted first, which manipulates prediction by manipulating the proportion of related stimuli across the experiment. If this is successful, a second study will manipulate prediction in a more natural language comprehension situation of reading sentences. The first, semantic priming study is what we are calling <b>Baleen</b>. Testing sessions will also include a masked priming paradigm relevant for Gina's R01 (<b>MaskedMM</b>), and a short functional localizer paradigm of words and sentences (<b>ATLLoc</b>).</p>
		<p>SemPrMM studies involve 2 neuroimaging sessions per subject on separate days, one of fMRI and one of MEG/EEG. Schizophrenia patients come in for at least one additional session to be given multiple written assessments.</p>	
	<p>This is the first study using <a href="https://gate.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/wiki/kuperberg-lab/index.php/VTSD">VTSD</a> for stimulus presentation.</p>
