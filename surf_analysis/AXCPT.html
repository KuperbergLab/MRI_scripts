		<h1>AXCPT</h1>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>This is a cognitive task that looks at inhibition and use of context, developed by Jonathan Cohen and colleagues. There are 4 conditions, schematically illustrated as AX, AY, BX and BY. Letters are presented one at a time at a constant pace, and participants respond with a button press only when they see the sequence A-X. There must be 70% of A-X trials to get conflict in responding to the B-X or A-Y trials (in fact, the Bs and Ys can be any letter that is not visually similar to X).</p>
		<h2>Design:</h2>
		<p>In our study, to get the minimum 40 trials per condition you need for MEG, we have:</p>
 		<p>AX - 280</p>
 		<p>AY - 40</p>
 		<p>BX - 40</p>
 		<p>BY - 40 </p>
		<p>We have this divided into two runs of 200 stims each (where a stim is considered this kind of pair).</p>
		<h2>Task:</h2>
		<p>Subjects respond during the AX trial.</p>
		<h2>Analyzed Contrasts:</h2>
