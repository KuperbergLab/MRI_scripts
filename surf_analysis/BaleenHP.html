		<h1>BaleenMM (High Probablity)</h1>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<h2>Design:</h2>
		<p>2 x 2 design (priming x proportion) 40 items per 4 conditions, plus tons of fillers</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Block1: low proportion, includes 40 related targets and 40 unrelated targets.</li>
			<li>Block2: high proportion, includes 40 related targets and 40 unrelated targets.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each block has 4 runs for a total of 8 runs</p> 
		<ul>
			<li> The 2 sessions are identical in structure but have completely different stimuli.</li>
			<li> The main analysis is on the target words in the 4 conditions of interest. For each session we have 4 different possible lists that a subject could get. That’s because each individual target word, like ‘PEPPER’ needs to appear in each of the 4 conditions across different subjects: lowProp Related, highProp Related, lowProp Unrelated, and highProp Unrelated.</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>For example: Subject 1 - sees SALT-PEPPER in lowProp Block;Subject 2 - sees SALT-PEPPER in highProp Block;Subject 3 - sees PLUS-PEPPER in lowProp Block;Subject 4 - sees PLUS-PEPPER in highProp Block.</p>
		<p>Item lists will be created in text files, each row should have a prime, target, and condition code. The Psychtoolbox script just reads in these text files.</p> 
		<ul>
			<li> In fMRI, regular trials will be interspersed with fixation trials of different durations according to optseq algorithm. The total time in fixation trials = the time it takes to present 40 regular trials.</li>
		</ul> 
		<h2>Task:</h2>
		<p>Subjects are instructed to press a button as quickly as they can whenever they see an animal word. Animal words are always targets...this allows us to look at the effect of prediction on the animal probes across lowProp and highProp blocks.</p>
		<p>The presentation script does not wait for a response to proceed, because there is no overt response on non-animal trials.</p>
		<h2>Analyzed Contrasts:</h2>

		<a href="BaleenHP/UnRel.html">Unrelated</a><br />
