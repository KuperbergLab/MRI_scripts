		<h1>ATLLoc</h1>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>This is a language localizer. It contrasts lists of consonant strings, lists of words, and sentences, all of these trials being 9 items long. It is called ATLLoc because the sentence - word contrast should elicit Anterior Temporal Lobe contrast.</p>
		<h2>Design:</h2>
		<p>20 9-word items in 3 conditions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sentences</li>
			<li>Word Lists</li>
			<li>Nonword Lists (random strings)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Just two lists, for the two sessions. Half of the sentences and noun lists from each are taken from Rogalsky &amp; Hickok (these are numbered 101-120 and 201-220). The other half for the sentences are based around the frames from the original sentences, with different content words. The other half for the words are nouns that didn't appear in the rest of the experiment.</p>
		<p>The nonword lists include 9 consonant strings, matched in length to the words from the word list in the other session.</p>
		<p>The two lists without optseq schedules are in (Scott's laptop)/Users/scottburns/Documents/MATLAB/stims/ATLLoc/ATL_101 and ATL_102.</p>
